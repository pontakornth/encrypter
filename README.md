# Encrypter

Encrypt your file using AES. Obviously not safe.


**Built for learning. Please don't use**


## Usage

`encrypter -m [encrypt|decrypt] <input_file_path> <output_file_path>`


In this program, encrypt and decrypt do same thing but keep as serparate mode for future.

Currently, wrong key will lead to wrong file. There is no validation for now.
